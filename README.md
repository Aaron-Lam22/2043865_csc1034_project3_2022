# Bank Project

The aim of this project was to make a basic bank code that can add
edit and remove clients. I used CSV to formulate a table of the 
clients and had to import datetime for adding the date of births.

The majority of the code is defining different variables that make it
functional. That in itself isn't too difficult. I think that the hardest part
of doing this project was working out how to get different if 
statements to work and research on different  new things about 
python that I didn't know before.

Overall I learnt a lot during this project, and hope to take it through to more projects in the future
